## Project Overview
The **Little Lemon API** is a comprehensive back-end system developed as the final requirement for the Meta Full-Stack Professional Certificate. It serves as a restaurant management platform capable of handling user authentication, menu management, and booking systems via a RESTful architecture.

As an aspiring **Data Analyst**, I utilized this project to master the "under-the-hood" mechanics of data: how relational databases are structured, how APIs transmit data, and how Python can be used to automate complex server-side logic.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python (managed via Pipenv)
* **Backend Framework:** Django & Django Rest Framework (DRF)
* **Database Management:** SQLite (Relational Schema Design)
* **Authentication:** Djoser (JWT & Token-based)
* **API Testing:** Insomnia / Postman

## Key Features & Data Logic
* **Relational Database Management:** Designed and implemented schemas to manage relationships between Menu Categories, Items, and Customer Orders.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Configured permission classes to secure data access for Managers, Delivery Crew, and Customers.
* **Filtering & Search:** Implemented server-side logic to allow efficient querying and sorting of the restaurant's menu dataset.
* **Data Integrity:** Integrated Django serializers to validate incoming data and ensure consistency across the database.

## Repository Structure
* `/LittleLemon` - Main project configuration and settings.
* `/LittleLemonAPI` - Application logic including Models, Serializers, and ViewSets.
* `manage.py` - Django administrative command-line utility.
* `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock` - Python dependency management files.
* `db.sqlite3` - Local relational database file.
